# Command Line Options
Our program is executed with ./Program.py on Linux, with Shebang, interpreted by python3, or python3 Program.py on Windows.

## --data-folder x

`x` should be a path to the folder holding the dataset. If the specified folder doesnâ€™t have data, the program will download one from Kaggle API. By default, `x` is `../data`.

## --model x

Choose a model to run. `x` should be a model name, choose from RandomForest or DecisionTree. By default `x` is `RandomForest`.

## --relevance x

Only tags with relevance greater than or equal to `x` will be considered as relevant tags to a movie. By default, `x` is `0.46`.

## --parallel x

If `x` is an integer, the program uses `x` processes. If `x` is `auto`, the program will determine the proper number of processes. By default, `x` is `auto`.

## --first-users x

The program will only test users whose ID is less than or equal to `x`. This option is for fast experiment. If this option is present, submit.csv will not be generated.

To reproduce our results, the following command line should be used:

```
./Program.py 
```

which is the same as

```
./Program.py --model RandomForest --parallel auto --relevance 0.46
```

The output is like this.
```
