## Decision Tree

`./DecisionTree.py`

`--model x`:

Choose a model to run. `x` should be a file name inside the src folder. By default the program uses `DecisionTree`.

`--parallel x`:

If the option is not specified, the program uses 1 thread/process. If x is an integer, the program uses x threads/processes. If x is `auto`, the program will determine the proper number of threads.
